                    Hi there! My name is Bob van Luijt, I run an innovation studio, art lab and music production company called Kubrickology.<br />I make autonomous (digital) work and I work as a freelance Creative/Strategic Prototyper for corporations, startups and individuals.<br />Technology, art and music are equally important to me.<br />
                    I am very much in favor of Open Source solutions and decentralized solutions such as Bitcoin. The collaborative character of open source and improvisation are the main principles that I base my work on.
                    
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    I honestly can’t remember a time when I wasn’t heavily attracted to music. Around the age of 14, I knew that one day I would be studying music. And so I did. I got my bachelor's in The Netherlands and during my master's (which, by the way, I never finished) I got a grant to study at Berklee College of Music in the USA. Evt nog een toevoeging hier. The most important thing in music, for me, is the pure abstraction and strange form of beauty (or ‘beauty by ugliness’, as I tend to call it). At a young age I fell in love with improvised music and contemporary music. Music and my (continuous) search for aesthetics have a strong influence on all my other work.

					<h3>Technology</h3>
                    I remember that as a 10 year old, I rented a qBasic book for kids in the library, and wrote my first line of code in Qbasic. It asked for my name, and next it would prompt: “Hi, Bob, how are you?”. Back then I thought this was magic- and I still do.<br />
                    Till this day I really like to work with technology, especially open-source and online. Technology enables me to easily create my autonomous work, or prototypes and ideas that I come up with for my clients. I think we can only grasp a fraction of the possibilities that lay ahead of us. I build all my software and prototypes using open source software. This is because I tend to have a high regard for the strength of the community that surrounds open source (also see “talks”). But in the end, I think it’s more about the actual output than about the tools used to generate that output.
                    As mentioned above, I use tech not only for my own projects, but also for my clients. I serve a wide variety of clients ranging from individuals to large corporations.
                    
                    <h3>Art</h3>
					I like to express myself in different ways, sometimes with sound, other times with technology, painting, poetry, etcetera.
<br />
I have a fascination for ‘the future’, for themes like sharing, aesthetics, (its potential influence on) society, wabi sabi, etcetera. Things like: “Internet of Things”, “Altered Reality”, “Social networks”, “Bitcoin”, “Privacy”, “Today’s craftmanship” and many other related themes are of influence on my work.
